        <h2>RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O.
            Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
          </li>

          <li>
            The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down,
            across, or diagonally) is the winner. 4. When all 9 squares are
            full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game
            ends in a tie.
          </li>
        </ul>
